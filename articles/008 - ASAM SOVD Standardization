# üîç Demystifying Diagnostics ‚Äì ASAM SOVD: From 1.0 to 1.2 and Beyond

After two intense days of collaborative discussion, the ASAM SOVD 1.2 Content Definition Workshop has wrapped up ‚Äî and I‚Äôm excited to share a recap of where we‚Äôve been, where we are, and where we‚Äôre heading.

This article is part of my ongoing series exploring diagnostics standardization from a hands-on, real-world perspective. In this edition, I‚Äôll walk through the evolution of the SOVD standard, how the drafting process works, what I expected to see discussed (and what actually happened), and what‚Äôs next for the community.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ From 1.0 to 1.1 and Now 1.2: A Quick Recap

The journey of the SOVD standard began with version 1.0, which laid the foundation for a modern, service-oriented diagnostics API. It introduced key concepts like resource-based access, OpenAPI-driven definitions, and a shift toward RESTful communication.

Version 1.1 brought refinements, clarifications, and early feedback from pilot implementations. It also aligned more closely with international standardization efforts, leading to the ISO Draft International Standard (DIS) version.

Now, with version 1.2 on the horizon, the focus is shifting toward **real-world scalability**, **multi-client orchestration**, and **cross-domain interoperability** ‚Äî especially for complex vehicle architectures and multi-vendor ecosystems.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ How the Drafting Process Works

The drafting of ASAM SOVD 1.1 and the ISO DIS version followed a structured, collaborative process:

- **Working groups** formed around areas of shared interest, manifested with ASAM and ISO comment resolution meetings, each with dedicated contributors and sometimes very detailed change proposals.
- **Company-specific proposals** were submitted, discussed, and refined.
- **Consensus-building** was emphasized ‚Äî not every idea made it in the ISO DIS version, but all were heard. Those that were considered still valuable where hand back to ASAM into a well documented "wishlist", the backlog of all the SOVD change requests.
- **ISO alignment** was pursued in parallel, with the goal of harmonizing ASAM and ISO deliverables, accepting comments&change requests from both the ASAM participants and the formal ISO DIS international voting.

The ASAM SOVD 1.2 process continues this model, with a stronger emphasis on **cluster-based ownership** and **active contribution**. 
Each cluster has now a clearly assigned expert and will be self organizing the real work meetings.
Each cluster is expected to produce its own requirement set, with regular checkpoints and physical meetings planned through 2026 in order to keep all of the clusters aligned at the broader ASAM working group level.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ What‚Äôs Next?

The road to ASAM SOVD 1.2 is long ‚Äî but well-paved:

- **December 2025**: Official Kick-Off Meeting
- **February 2026**: First physical checkpoint
- **June 2026**: Draft requirements finalized per cluster
- **March 2028**: Target release of ASAM SOVD 1.2

Each cluster will now begin its deep-dive work, with contributors expected to commit time and expertise. Whether you‚Äôre a tool vendor, OEM, or developer ‚Äî this is the moment to get involved.

## üß≠ Final Thoughts

The SOVD standard is evolving fast ‚Äî and it‚Äôs doing so in the open. If you care about diagnostics, interoperability, and the future of software-defined vehicles, now is the time to contribute, learn, and shape what comes next.

During these two days, what struck me most was not the complexity of the proposals, but the quality of listening.
Even in a room full of experts, with decades of experience, people were open to challenge, reframe, and rebuild ideas together.
This, to me, is what standardization should mean ‚Äî not convergence by compromise, but progress through understanding.

Stay tuned for more in the next #DemystifyingDiagnostics article ‚Äî where I‚Äôll explore some of these clusters in depth, while expanding the sovd-lab examples accordingly.
