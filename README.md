# Diagnostics Demystified

Short, IP‑safe versions of my diagnostics articles. Full editions live on CARIAD Confluence (VW Group visibility). Runnable demos live in  sovd-lab [1](https://github.com/MauroCerrato/sovd-lab).

## Why I’m writing this
I learn best by turning standards into clear stories and runnable examples. SOVD makes web‑style diagnostics tangible (HTTP/REST + JSON + OAuth), and I use simple, anonymized demos to keep things reusable and safe.

## How Articles and Lab Connect
Each article explains a concept; each lab scenario makes it runnable.  
Example: Article `004` (OBD-II basics) → Demo in `obd2-sovd-sim`.
